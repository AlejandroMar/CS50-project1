# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### error
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'werkzeug.contrib' flask no longer supports werkzeug.contrib.cached so the module has been depreacted and moved to a separeted package called cachelib
so I have to install it and inport it in the sessions package.
I also saved the cachelib library in requirements.txt
