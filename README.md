# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### error
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'werkzeug.contrib'. 
Flask no longer supports werkzeug.contrib.cached, the module has been moved to a separate package called cachelib.
I have to install it and import it in the sessions package code where the error occurs.
I also saved the cachelib library in requirements.txt
